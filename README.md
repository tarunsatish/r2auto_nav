# r2auto_nav
ROS2 auto_nav code for EG2310

pls go to mapping.py

1. we use the right-hand rule. i.e. always trace the wall at the righ hand side

2. we set the 200 deg and 300 deg of the lidar as the two edges and hence determine the next-stage motion

3. we have 3 modes of the rotatebot, to change the radius of the rotation
